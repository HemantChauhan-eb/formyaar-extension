# FormYaar Extension — Changelog

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Operator queue stuck on "Loading queue…" — backend calls (`/operator/subscription`, `/operator/queue`) now wrapped in try/catch so a failed request no longer leaves the screen frozen; queue falls back gracefully
- Corrected backend URL — `.env.development` / `.env.production` were pointing at the old `formyaar-backend-production.up.railway.app` host (now `-a43e`), which caused 404s and apparent CORS failures on the operator dashboard

### Added
- Open the panel from any formyaar.in button via a custom DOM event (`fy:open-panel`) — zero server load
- DOB field auto-formats to DD/MM/YYYY (auto-inserts slashes, clamps day ≤ 31 and month ≤ 12)

### Changed
- F·Y tab shake interval 12s → 10s, scales from the right edge (no longer clipped by the screen)
- Maintenance status check moved to run after panel creation so it never delays autofill on page load

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- Operator in-progress resume flow — when an operator accepts a submission and closes the tab mid-fill, the submission is saved to `storage.local` (`fy_op_inprogress`). Reopening the panel shows an amber "In Progress" section above the queue with Resume and Done buttons. Resume re-prepares the submission data and opens NSDL in a new tab; Done manually clears it.
- `prepareOperatorSubmission` extracted from `runAutofillFromSubmission` — shared by both the accept handler and the resume button so submission data is always staged before navigation

### Fixed
- Autofill panel jitter — programmatic clicks dispatched by the autofill engine (radio buttons, checkboxes, next-step buttons) were bubbling to `document` and triggering the click-outside handler, causing the panel to rapidly slide out and back in during fills with many skipped fields. Click-outside handler now ignores all clicks while `#fy-filling` is visible.
- Operator accept/resume now opens NSDL in a new tab (`window.open`) instead of navigating the current page
- Maintenance check no longer delays panel creation — panel is created immediately so autofill screen transitions work on page load; maintenance status is checked in the background and swaps content only if ON

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- Defence personnel AO code selection — Army (PNE/W/55/3) and Air Force (DEL/W/72/2) hardcoded; filled directly based on `defence_branch` when `is_defence` is true
- Defence branch radio selector in user data form (shown only when "Defence personnel" is checked)

### Changed
- AO code step completely reworked: backend already resolves the exact AO code from city configs (`/pincode/:pin`), so the state dropdown → city dropdown → Fetch button → table selection dance is gone — values are written directly into `#area_code`, `#ao_type`, `#range_code`, `#ao_num`
- Shake animation on F·Y tab icon: amplitude doubled (±4px → ±8px) and interval halved (25s → 12s) for more visibility

## [0.4.9] — 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- Operator submission flow set `autofillActive` without a `done` array — caused a crash on every page load (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')`), silently breaking auto-run for the token page and first step of `endUserLogin.html`
- Token page (`input.tokenButton`) was skipped by the URL deduplication logic because it reloads at the same URL as step 1 — added DOM-state detection to always run autofill on the token page regardless of `done`

## [0.4.8] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- Clear data (trash) button on home screen — wipes `fy_user_data`, `fy_active_session`, and session-only sensitive fields in one tap with confirmation prompt

### Changed
- Real Razorpay payment flow now live and tested end-to-end
- `flex-wrap` on home screen footer action buttons to prevent overflow on narrow panels
- `position: relative` on home container to anchor the clear-data button

## [0.4.5] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- Bundled `pan_card.json` in `public/configs/` as offline fallback; backend remains primary source so live updates still apply
- Back button on the operator queue screen → returns to home screen
- Form-data guard on the "Continue" button — if no local form details exist (e.g. recovered on a new browser), shows a message instead of starting a broken autofill
- Telemetry disclosure in the panel footer
- VERSION displayed in panel header for quick build-verification

### Fixed
- Click-outside handler closing the panel when a button removed itself from the DOM (form back button) — added `document.contains(e.target)` check
- Post-payment flow no longer races storage writes against `window.location.href` — now awaits both `autofillActive` and `fy_active_session` writes before navigating
- Post-payment now navigates to NSDL only when not already there (avoids infinite-loop opening of NSDL tab from the PAN card click)
- AO code autofill: waits for `#state_aoCode` dropdown to populate via MutationObserver instead of fixed delay
- Misleading "we never store your information" copy → now accurately reads "saved only on your device — never on our servers"
- Unsupported-site popup: replaced specific government form list with a single formyaar.in link (less misleading, simpler)

### Changed
- `aadhaar_number` removed from `UserData` interface — extension never collects or stores full Aadhaar; only `aadhaar_last_4` (session-only)
- `aadhaar_last_4` moved into `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` (session-only storage)
- `runAutofillFromSubmission` derives `aadhaar_last_4` from any `aadhaar_number` field in operator submissions and discards the rest
- `save-session` request body trimmed: only `order_id`, `mobile`, `form_type` sent to backend — never form data
- Recover-session flow no longer restores `form_data` from server (server doesn't store it anymore)
- Config fetch is backend-first with bundled fallback (was backend-only)

### Removed
- `scripting` permission from manifest (never used)
- Dead `aadhaar_first_8` derived-field logic in autofill

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-23

### Added
- Version number displayed in panel header (`v{VERSION}`)
- Pending sessions card in home screen — shows in-progress forms with **Continue** and **Discard** buttons
- Cross-device session recovery by phone number now lands back on home screen and shows the pending card
- Local AO code resolver: backend returns resolved `ao_code` for known cities, extension uses it to match the exact NSDL table row instead of guessing the first valid one

### Fixed
- Subscription check treated `NULL` `subscription_expires_at` as expired — now treated as never-expiring
- AO code autofill: added MutationObserver wait for `#state_aoCode` dropdown to populate before selecting (was failing silently due to 150ms timing race)
- Pincode API: wraps `response.json()` in its own try-catch so an HTML error page from `postalpincode.in` no longer causes an unhandled 500

### Changed
- Sensitive fields (`aadhaar_number`, `passport_number`, `tin_number`) now stored in `sessionStorage` only — cleared when browser closes, never sent to backend
- `form_data` sent to backend on `save-session` no longer includes sensitive fields
- Resume system fully reworked: removed the old auto-popup resume screen that appeared on NSDL visits; replaced with a persistent "In Progress" card on the main panel home screen
- `autofillActive` in extension session storage still auto-runs autofill within an active browser session (navigating between NSDL steps); only cross-session resume requires user action

### Removed
- `renderResumeScreen` and `showResumeScreen` — replaced by `refreshPendingSessions` inline card
- Auto-show of resume screen on NSDL page load
